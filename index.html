        <div class="curatorial-text">
          <p class="text">The New Media Artspace is proud to present <cite>Gabriela Vainsencher: Inheritance</cite>, a
            solo exhibition of single-channel videos alongside sculptural and photographic media. Inheritance brings
            together four video works created between 2014 and 2016 (exhibited in-person and online), in particular one
            created through dialog with her mother. These works are accompanied by details of one of Vainsencher's
            large-scale ceramic works from 2021 (exhibited online only) created after she became a mother herself, as
            well
            as artifacts of her practice (exhibited in-person only), including ceramics and photographic props that
            appear
            in the videos and provide context for these works. The exhibition sets a frame for understanding
            Vainsencher's
            work over this span of several years, and that work in turn is enframed by her experiences being Jewish,
            Israeli, Argentine, trilingual, an immigrant—and no less, being a daughter and a mother.</p>
          <p class="text">Emerging from this intersectional inherited identity, Vainsencher's feminist artistic practice
            highlights learning as a non-hierarchical collective process. This extends to an emphasis on community, on
            text and commentary such as the Talmudic practice of framing a text with other texts, and on learning from
            one's elders and learning together, all of which Vainsencher attributes to Jewish traditions. Vainsencher's
            creative process revolves around dialog, textual commentary, and collaboration. In turn, this “revolving” is
            literalized in the forms of her videos and sculptures, which are continually circling around, looping,
            swerving, turning, and not quite returning. From speech comes stutters, from touch comes porosity, from
            openings come closures, from surfaces come circularity, from daughters come mothers. Vainsencher's works are
            always coming around again with layered meanings, which the artist holds open to make space for
            interpretation
            and transformation.</p>
          <hr>
          <p class="text"><cite>Negative Capability</cite> begins with a shot of the upper torso of a woman (the artist)
            wearing a black shirt and nearly disappearing against a black background. Her hands and throat, exposed
            above
            the neckline and below the sleeves or her garment, are the only parts of her body that are visible against
            the
            black void. Also visible is an object, a cylindrical ceramic sculpture, which she holds with both hands in
            front of her chest at the dead center of the frame. She rotates this object aiming its mouth at the camera,
            and in sync the video image moves in and out of focus, as though by manipulating the hollow sculpture she
            controls the focal ring on the lens. After a few turns, an older woman's voice commences a one-sided
            conversation, speaking in Hebrew which at times gives way to Spanish, while white subtitles in English pop
            up
            in staccato rhythms of short phrases usually offset toward the bottom or sides of the frame. The cryptic
            narration mixes anecdotes, metaphors, humor, and wisdom. Generally, it seems to concern coming to terms with
            what isn't known or knowable, what may or may not happen. Eventually it becomes evident that the narrator is
            discussing her practice as a psychoanalyst.</p>
          <p class="text">Like talk therapy itself, once it begins the voice doesn't stop. Instead, the image shifts:
            hands, always doing, manipulate rolling and sliding abstract ceramic forms; a throat swallows; the figure
            hides behind masks; more cylindrical forms rotate around her missing head, obscuring it; hands attempt to
            piece two ceramic fragments together to form a circle, but the gaps are too wide to close its loop and any
            way
            she turns the fragments spans only half the curve. </p>
          <p class="text">Eventually the narrator explains the meaning of the phrase “negative capability,” a concept
            introduced by the poet Keats to refer to “the ability to be suspended in not knowing, … not having closure …
            not doing.” The narrator praises this difficult work of keeping things unknown, not rushing to closure.
            Finally, after the figure disappears and against an image of undulating waves, comes a question from the
            narrator, the artist's mother, who asks “What's this all about Gabriela?” and then—like the analyst she
            is—begins to speculate as to her daughter's motivations, but—like the mother she is—with laughter.</p>
          <p class="text">On one level, <cite>Negative Capability</cite> explores intergenerational communication and
            miscommunication. The psychoanalyst mother works in her medium—talking and words—while the artist daughter
            works in her medium—images and objects. The two parts never quite align in form; yet, in content they are in
            uncannily perfect alignment. This is because on another level, the piece compares how mother and daughter
            both
            contend with something similar in the different work they do. Both engage a process. Both allow space for an
            empty center—the unknown that must be held in abeyance to keep a process—whether creative or
            therapeutic—richly alive. Vainsencher has written about the how analysis and art share an investment in
            interpretation.<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a> For each, the empty center holds an elusive meaning
            that
            can't be arrived at or even
            articulated, or else the artwork would be trite, or else the self-realization would be too pat, or worse
            externalized (as the mother points out in her first lines).</p>
          <p class="text"><cite>Negative Capability</cite> originated in audio recordings of phone conversations between
            the artist and her mother, which she first painstakingly transcribed, then translated, then remixed. Only at
            the last step did she abandon her devotion to faithfully conveying her mother's words. In this artfully
            (re)interpreted conversation with her mother, Vainsencher emphasizes a process giving rise to a collectively
            authored frame circling an unknown, which she likens to the <cite>Gamra</cite> page in Talmudic traditions.
            At
            the center of a Gamra page sits holy text, and enframing that text are other texts consisting in mutable
            commentary. In the case of <cite>Negative Capability</cite>, the mother's text lies at the center, and the
            framing commentary, open to interpretation, is the artwork that emerges from the daughter's reworking. This
            encircling processing of a holy or wholly unknowable connects psychoanalytic process and artistic process,
            as
            both attempt to apprehend something intangible at their heart.</p>
          <p class="text">The complementarity of two disciplines in <cite>Negative Capability</cite> is explored
            figuratively in the next video, <cite>Duet</cite>, which features another collaborator of Vainsencher's, the
            dancer and choreographer Leslie Satin. Satin faces the camera with the tight frame grazing her forehead and
            chin. Her face is in slow but constant motion. As she moves her head side to side, like indicating a silent
            “no,” the camera swivels on a tripod, mimicking her movement. The duet unfolds as parallel movements between
            the discipline of performance represented by Satin, and the discipline of video, represented by
            Vainsencher's
            camera.
          </p>
          <p class="text">In this duet, the empty center is where the dancer's gaze and the gaze of the lens intersect.
            Continuing the themes of <cite>Negative Capability</cite>, Satin's solemn refusal suggests a negation, while
            both the shaking head and the panning camera follow the arc of a semicircle. Combined, the two might make a
            complete circle, but instead they draw attention to the empty space between the performer and the lens. The
            simple eloquence of <cite>Duet</cite> is to hold empty that space between them, which is Vainsencher's
            invitation for the viewer to fill in their own experience.<a href="#footnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
            Vainsencher's
            intention is to make room for the viewer, which she understand requires an artist not take up all of the
            space
            herself, burdening an artwork with overprescribed meaning. Following the garrulous <cite>Negative
              Capability</cite>, this silent video might even be interpreted as its inverse. Whereas Vainsencher's
            mother
            only speaks and never appears in <cite>Negative Capability</cite>, Satin's face embodies the frame as she
            shakes her head “no” in a refusal to speak.</p>
          <p class="text">Satin appears again in <cite>Leslie Across the Floor</cite>. Again, much as <cite>Negative
              Capability</cite> locates a common ground between artistic and psychoanalytic process, <cite>Leslie Across
              the Floor</cite> explores a feature in common between the two collaborators' disciplines, video and dance.
            Both utilize entrances and exits and the choreography of this video is reduced to exactly that. Satin enters
            from the left side of the frame, inchworming on her back along the floor until she exits at the frame's
            right
            side. Unlike <cite>Duets</cite> which focuses exclusively on Satin's face, here her head is turned away from
            the camera so that her face is never visible. The movement of her body is exaggerated by foley audio which
            unexpectedly substitutes the sound of dragging heavy metal in place of the softer sounds of cloth and flesh
            on
            floor.</p>
          <p class="text">Entrances and exits, and the anticipation they entail, are performed again in the last video,
            <cite>Here It Comes</cite> but this time the performer is the ocean. Recalling the final watery image of
            <cite>Negative Capability</cite>, this video shows waves lapping against a coast. As the waves slowly roll
            in,
            choruses of whispers repeat “Here it comes” overlapping with “It's coming.” Just as the ocean's waves never
            stop, the anticipation never reaches a conclusion. Instead, this video holds our attention, like the voices
            hold their breath and gasp for air. The empty center of <cite>Here It Comes</cite> is that which might come,
            which might fill in what's missing from an evacuated center constantly being washed away, sucked back to sea
            like the vacuumed void of undertow.
          </p>
          <p class="text">In the online version of the exhibition, each video is bordered by close detail images from
            one
            of Vainsencher's largescale ceramic works, <cite>Mom</cite>. The sculpture itself is a wall-scaled relief
            work
            showing a twisting looping, many-limbed figure. Created after the birth of Vainsencher's first child,
            <cite>Mom</cite> shows the many roles she takes on as a daughter turned mother to a daughter. As though
            pulled
            in many directions, the clay surface bears the touch of a million clamoring fingerprints. The deeply
            textured
            surfaces recall the busy hands manipulating clay objects in <cite>Negative Capability</cite>. In
            <cite>Mom</cite>, hands are also constantly doing things, now cooking, shampooing, and carrying. In
            <cite>Inheritance</cite>, the textures of <cite>Mom</cite> mimic the enframing form of the
            <cite>Gamra</cite>
            page, also becoming a frame for the video works Vainsencher created as her mother's daughter.
          </p>
          <p class="text">Many of the works in the exhibition take the visual shape of a frame: from the hollow ceramic
            cylinders and circles in <cite>Negative Capability</cite>, to the panning semi-circle arcs gestured in
            <cite>Duet</cite>, to the bracketing device of entrances and exits that motivate <cite>Leslie Across the
              Floor</cite>, to the anticipation that holds attention in <cite>Here It Comes</cite>, to the curatorial
            decision to use the textures of <cite>Mom</cite> as a border around video works. These enframing forms make
            reference to the Talmud which inspires the design of the <cite>Inheritance</cite> exhibition. They also
            function much like a family does—they encircle, enshrine, and protect something precious at the center.
          </p>
          <p class="text">Vainsencher is also inspired by the Jewish practice of learning together,
            <cite>Be'Tzavta</cite>, which she loosely translates as “as a team; together.” <cite>Be'Tzavta</cite>
            involves
            reading as a group and discussing a text while seated together in a circle, a practiced she was introduced
            to
            by the artist Ofri Cnaani's feminist reading group at AIR gallery. Once again, “there is a center but the
            center is empty.” Vainsencher consciously connects <cite>Be'Tzavta</cite> to the anti-hierarchical feminist
            approaches she applies throughout her work. At Baruch, she will present a special participatory performance
            of
            <cite>Here It Comes</cite> that literally embodies <cite>Be'Tzavta</cite> circular communal form.
            Additionally, at the New Media Artspace in-person exhibition, she shares several of the artifacts and
            process
            pieces that contribute to her work, inviting viewers into her process by creating an intimate learning
            community in the Newman Library. Mirroring the <cite>Gamra</cite> page and the <cite>Be'Tzavta</cite>
            practices, encircling text and (re)interpretive commentary underpin Vainsencher's process at every level. In
            <cite>Inheritance</cite>, these are continually come around, revolving and enframing through the artist's
            reinventions, reincarnations, and inheritances.

            Gabriela Vainsencher speaks with Silvia Ruzanka</h2>
          <p class="text"><span class="italic">[Past artist interview for lorem ipsum]
              This year the New Media Artspace presents two solo exhibitions by Sarada Rauch and
              Kerry Downey that both address political consciousness as craftwork.
              In conjunction with Rauch's exhibition, Downey interviews Rauch as the
              first part of a two-way dialogue between the artists on their works in relation to these and more
              ideas.</span></p><br>
          <p class="text"><span>
              Kerry Downey: While your work reads to me as playful, intuitive and process-based, the way you make things
              also doubles as a reflection of the way we are all produced through power relations. There's a feminist
              and
              queer radicality, even an anarchism in your work that's really potent. In Topple, you are taking on and
              taking
              down racist and fascist public monuments (and I might add, years before the popularized public concern
              over
              Confederate monuments). Topple is so simple, so beautifully direct—an anti-monument, anti-anthem jingle
              for
              the revolution. It's like: it's not that hard people, let's just take them down! Because you've handmade
              the
              monuments in miniature, this work reminds us, they're just fragile, human-made objects. None of this
              history
              is stuck and yet history repeats. <br>Can you talk about the connection between the macro and micro,
              between
              the dying star and the toppled monument, or between the hierarchical symbol of the monument and the scale
              of
              hand?<br>
              Sarada Rauch: My process is intuitive in some regards, but mostly at the beginning. My work begins with
              historical and scientific research which I digest through prose and poetry. I create snapshots of imagery
              from
              these words and string them together to create a narrative. Then I start constructing the visual.<br>
              I love shifting perspectives in my work. My miniature environments encompass large sculptures through
              digital
              collage, or my hand intrudes into the scale of the scene. The miniature environments I build become larger
              than what they are mimicking.<br>
              In general, I am interested in how power works. I conflate scale to shift perspective, and play with
              micro-viewing and macro-viewing. As an individual, independent actions are micro, but are part of a larger
              macro system. Small acts can lead to rebellion. Small individual microcosms can spark protest. It is
              almost
              tacky, the metaphor. Power systems being so huge, and one individual being so small, then I reverse it. An
              individual is powerful and the paradigm is small and malleable. The micro becomes macro.<br>
              KD: In your videos you construct a lot of spaces inside spaces. You can see from inside a living room
              window
              out into a strange turbulent landscape. Inside it's cozy, outside it's war and I have a hand in it remind
              me
              of Martha Rosler's Bringing the War Home series, where two seemingly disparate worlds, the domestic and
              military spheres are shown in close proximity. As rooms open up into other rooms, you have us zooming in
              and
              out, so that our perspective is beingframed and reframed. You also embed video monitors inside altered
              found
              objects like picture frames. I never think what I'm watching is “real,” I always know it's a construct.
              Yet I
              believe in the worlds you're making, I'm invested in them and feel close to them—I'm a voyeur and
              participant!
              How do you conceive of the role of framing or constructing spaces/places for your audience?<br>
              SR: When making a video, I think of it as creating a universe that has its own scientific logic and
              aesthetics. I am really into facts-based world building like science fiction, speculative biology, and
              game
              art. I view science fiction as a new folklore, it imagines new narratives from ancient stories.
              Speculative
              Biology is similar, imagining different facts-based possibilities. In game art, you create the physical
              environment with its own set of rules. You also often create a whole narrative and character development,
              and
              the characters themselves. There are no limitations of reality.<br>
              The what if's of these genres attract me. What if this line of evolution went this way instead? What if
              our
              society took this turn? The uncharted territories, without already worn paths, is a collective think tank.
              This type of imagination can be a powerful political action.<br>
              KD: Your work has an abundance of amazing retro influences, from early MTV to early sci-fi to video art
              pioneers like Joan Jonas. A thru-line in this is a willingness to make aspects of your process
              transparent,
              showing your hand, so-to-speak, creating this amazing DIY aesthetic and collage sensibility. Seeing
              evidence
              of your hand's craftsmanship feels very inviting and engaging. It makes the work feel accessible and I
              find
              myself wondering how you made it, or feeling like, oh, I could make that! Can you talk a bit about the
              significance of your lo-fi, hand-spun techniques—their intentions and influences?<br>
              SR: I wish I could claim intention, and pretend this style was a choice from the beginning, butit's not.
              The
              choice I made was choosing to be myself rather than fail at being something I was not. I tried really hard
              in
              some early years to be a cleaner, slicker, less emotional artist. And I justcould not do it. Once I
              admitted
              to myself that I would continue failing at being clean, slick and super-conceptual, I moved towards the
              way I
              was naturally. I embraced it as a choice and got into it.</br>
              In a digital world there is an ability to create more dimensions, and build something abstract. I am able
              to
              conflate scale, like inserting a large sculpture into a small landscape, or collaging a variety of
              perspectives into one plane. Yet the tactile, physical world shows my hand within the process of making.
              My
              handcraft is imperfect, and there is an emotional intelligence to things that are imperfect. My pieces
              acknowledge their own silliness and because of this they can also dabble with being genuine. They are
              winking
              at you while telling you something heartfelt.<br>
              As for references and influences, I had to choose to embrace myself with those as well. Growing up, the
              only
              shows I could watch on television were Star Trek, The Muppets and the PBS NewsHour. I had no connection to
              pop
              culture references. To join conversations with my peers, Ireplicated social cues and pop-culture
              references
              based on hearsay. My work is influenced by what I saw on the small screen as a child: ridiculously-fake
              set
              design mixed with current events,filtered through pop culture. I continue the practice of watching from a
              distance, and reenacting popular media as a way to understand the world I feel at odds with.<br>
              KD: In the realm of a dying star is classic Sarada Rauch. As a series of DIY music videos with “sides A &
              B”
              like cassette tapes, it brings together music, video, collage, sculpture, poetry – and through their
              karaoke
              renditions, performance. Like Tracy and the Plastics, your work genre-crosses in a way that puts these
              different mediums not only in direct conversation with each other, but creates an interdependency between
              them, so that being interdisciplinary is much more than just working in a lot of mediums. It feels to me
              that
              the music needs the sculpture, the sculpture needs the moving image, the video needs the language, etc.
              How do
              you think of these mediums communicating with one another?<br>
              SR: I don't think of the different mediums as separate entities. I feel like they are different arms of
              the
              same body. Like how a painter uses color, or how you express yourself differently when speaking different
              languages. But to answer your question, I grew up in a family of artists and professional musicians. Early
              on
              before I was 10, my designated space was visual art. But when I was turning 20, and just moved to New
              York, I
              became terribly disgusted by the commercial art world here. I decided to swear off of art and become a
              musician. I purchased a twisted up acoustic guitar, and taught myself how to play it. I wrote songs and
              went
              out performing. I started making my own jug-band style instruments from household objects, out of
              financial
              necessity. However, I am wired towards the visual language. And turns out, I am terrible at performing my
              music live. My songs started to integrate performance art, which migrated back into making video and
              film.<br>
              My musician arm influenced the sculptor and video arms by being an amateur, and those arms influenced the
              music through pattern. I am what musicians call an “untrained” musician, which isthe equivalent to how
              artists
              call some people “outsider” artists—both terms and concepts that make me roll my eyes and fake barf. Not
              being
              “trained” in music allowed me to write with emotional intelligence, because I didn't know the rules. I was
              taught art since the moment I couldhold a pencil, with all the rules. I appreciate that knowledge, but it
              doesn't allow me to be as freewith my intuitive decisions. I chose to teach myself all things music
              because of
              this. In music, at times I can be more raw or silly. I write songs and music visually, mapping out the
              notes
              and chords like a drawing. This creates songs that have brazen meter modulation, or weird chord
              structure–so I
              have been told. And finally, as the child of an activist, I was bred on direct action. Protest songs are
              driven by their content, they are accessible and urgent. I feel an urgency right now that I cannot satiate
              with my art alone. Words are needed.<br>
