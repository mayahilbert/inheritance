        <div class="curatorial-text">
          <p class="text">The New Media Artspace is proud to present <cite>Gabriela Vainsencher: Inheritance</cite>, a
            solo exhibition of single-channel videos alongside sculptural and photographic media. Inheritance brings
            together four video works created between 2014 and 2016 (exhibited in-person and online), in particular one
            created through dialog with her mother. These works are accompanied by details of one of Vainsencher's
            large-scale ceramic works from 2021 (exhibited online only) created after she became a mother herself, as
            well
            as artifacts of her practice (exhibited in-person only), including ceramics and photographic props that
            appear
            in the videos and provide context for these works. The exhibition sets a frame for understanding
            Vainsencher's
            work over this span of several years, and that work in turn is enframed by her experiences being Jewish,
            Israeli, Argentine, trilingual, an immigrant—and no less, being a daughter and a mother.</p>
          <p class="text">Emerging from this intersectional inherited identity, Vainsencher's feminist artistic practice
            highlights learning as a non-hierarchical collective process. This extends to an emphasis on community, on
            text and commentary such as the Talmudic practice of framing a text with other texts, and on learning from
            one's elders and learning together, all of which Vainsencher attributes to Jewish traditions. Vainsencher's
            creative process revolves around dialog, textual commentary, and collaboration. In turn, this “revolving” is
            literalized in the forms of her videos and sculptures, which are continually circling around, looping,
            swerving, turning, and not quite returning. From speech comes stutters, from touch comes porosity, from
            openings come closures, from surfaces come circularity, from daughters come mothers. Vainsencher's works are
            always coming around again with layered meanings, which the artist holds open to make space for
            interpretation
            and transformation.</p>
          <hr>
          <p class="text"><cite>Negative Capability</cite> begins with a shot of the upper torso of a woman (the artist)
            wearing a black shirt and nearly disappearing against a black background. Her hands and throat, exposed
            above
            the neckline and below the sleeves or her garment, are the only parts of her body that are visible against
            the
            black void. Also visible is an object, a cylindrical ceramic sculpture, which she holds with both hands in
            front of her chest at the dead center of the frame. She rotates this object aiming its mouth at the camera,
            and in sync the video image moves in and out of focus, as though by manipulating the hollow sculpture she
            controls the focal ring on the lens. After a few turns, an older woman's voice commences a one-sided
            conversation, speaking in Hebrew which at times gives way to Spanish, while white subtitles in English pop
            up
            in staccato rhythms of short phrases usually offset toward the bottom or sides of the frame. The cryptic
            narration mixes anecdotes, metaphors, humor, and wisdom. Generally, it seems to concern coming to terms with
            what isn't known or knowable, what may or may not happen. Eventually it becomes evident that the narrator is
            discussing her practice as a psychoanalyst.</p>
          <p class="text">Like talk therapy itself, once it begins the voice doesn't stop. Instead, the image shifts:
            hands, always doing, manipulate rolling and sliding abstract ceramic forms; a throat swallows; the figure
            hides behind masks; more cylindrical forms rotate around her missing head, obscuring it; hands attempt to
            piece two ceramic fragments together to form a circle, but the gaps are too wide to close its loop and any
            way
            she turns the fragments spans only half the curve. </p>
          <p class="text">Eventually the narrator explains the meaning of the phrase “negative capability,” a concept
            introduced by the poet Keats to refer to “the ability to be suspended in not knowing, … not having closure …
            not doing.” The narrator praises this difficult work of keeping things unknown, not rushing to closure.
            Finally, after the figure disappears and against an image of undulating waves, comes a question from the
            narrator, the artist's mother, who asks “What's this all about Gabriela?” and then—like the analyst she
            is—begins to speculate as to her daughter's motivations, but—like the mother she is—with laughter.</p>
          <p class="text">On one level, <cite>Negative Capability</cite> explores intergenerational communication and
            miscommunication. The psychoanalyst mother works in her medium—talking and words—while the artist daughter
            works in her medium—images and objects. The two parts never quite align in form; yet, in content they are in
            uncannily perfect alignment. This is because on another level, the piece compares how mother and daughter
            both
            contend with something similar in the different work they do. Both engage a process. Both allow space for an
            empty center—the unknown that must be held in abeyance to keep a process—whether creative or
            therapeutic—richly alive. Vainsencher has written about the how analysis and art share an investment in
            interpretation.<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a> For each, the empty center holds an elusive meaning
            that
            can't be arrived at or even
            articulated, or else the artwork would be trite, or else the self-realization would be too pat, or worse
            externalized (as the mother points out in her first lines).</p>
          <p class="text"><cite>Negative Capability</cite> originated in audio recordings of phone conversations between
            the artist and her mother, which she first painstakingly transcribed, then translated, then remixed. Only at
            the last step did she abandon her devotion to faithfully conveying her mother's words. In this artfully
            (re)interpreted conversation with her mother, Vainsencher emphasizes a process giving rise to a collectively
            authored frame circling an unknown, which she likens to the <cite>Gamra</cite> page in Talmudic traditions.
            At
            the center of a Gamra page sits holy text, and enframing that text are other texts consisting in mutable
            commentary. In the case of <cite>Negative Capability</cite>, the mother's text lies at the center, and the
            framing commentary, open to interpretation, is the artwork that emerges from the daughter's reworking. This
            encircling processing of a holy or wholly unknowable connects psychoanalytic process and artistic process,
            as
            both attempt to apprehend something intangible at their heart.</p>
          <p class="text">The complementarity of two disciplines in <cite>Negative Capability</cite> is explored
            figuratively in the next video, <cite>Duet</cite>, which features another collaborator of Vainsencher's, the
            dancer and choreographer Leslie Satin. Satin faces the camera with the tight frame grazing her forehead and
            chin. Her face is in slow but constant motion. As she moves her head side to side, like indicating a silent
            “no,” the camera swivels on a tripod, mimicking her movement. The duet unfolds as parallel movements between
            the discipline of performance represented by Satin, and the discipline of video, represented by
            Vainsencher's
            camera.
          </p>
          <p class="text">In this duet, the empty center is where the dancer's gaze and the gaze of the lens intersect.
            Continuing the themes of <cite>Negative Capability</cite>, Satin's solemn refusal suggests a negation, while
            both the shaking head and the panning camera follow the arc of a semicircle. Combined, the two might make a
            complete circle, but instead they draw attention to the empty space between the performer and the lens. The
            simple eloquence of <cite>Duet</cite> is to hold empty that space between them, which is Vainsencher's
            invitation for the viewer to fill in their own experience.<a href="#footnote-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
            Vainsencher's
            intention is to make room for the viewer, which she understand requires an artist not take up all of the
            space
            herself, burdening an artwork with overprescribed meaning. Following the garrulous <cite>Negative
              Capability</cite>, this silent video might even be interpreted as its inverse. Whereas Vainsencher's
            mother
            only speaks and never appears in <cite>Negative Capability</cite>, Satin's face embodies the frame as she
            shakes her head “no” in a refusal to speak.</p>
          <p class="text">Satin appears again in <cite>Leslie Across the Floor</cite>. Again, much as <cite>Negative
              Capability</cite> locates a common ground between artistic and psychoanalytic process, <cite>Leslie Across
              the Floor</cite> explores a feature in common between the two collaborators' disciplines, video and dance.
            Both utilize entrances and exits and the choreography of this video is reduced to exactly that. Satin enters
            from the left side of the frame, inchworming on her back along the floor until she exits at the frame's
            right
            side. Unlike <cite>Duets</cite> which focuses exclusively on Satin's face, here her head is turned away from
            the camera so that her face is never visible. The movement of her body is exaggerated by foley audio which
            unexpectedly substitutes the sound of dragging heavy metal in place of the softer sounds of cloth and flesh
            on
            floor.</p>
          <p class="text">Entrances and exits, and the anticipation they entail, are performed again in the last video,
            <cite>Here It Comes</cite> but this time the performer is the ocean. Recalling the final watery image of
            <cite>Negative Capability</cite>, this video shows waves lapping against a coast. As the waves slowly roll
            in,
            choruses of whispers repeat “Here it comes” overlapping with “It's coming.” Just as the ocean's waves never
            stop, the anticipation never reaches a conclusion. Instead, this video holds our attention, like the voices
            hold their breath and gasp for air. The empty center of <cite>Here It Comes</cite> is that which might come,
            which might fill in what's missing from an evacuated center constantly being washed away, sucked back to sea
            like the vacuumed void of undertow.
          </p>
          <p class="text">In the online version of the exhibition, each video is bordered by close detail images from
            one
            of Vainsencher's largescale ceramic works, <cite>Mom</cite>. The sculpture itself is a wall-scaled relief
            work
            showing a twisting looping, many-limbed figure. Created after the birth of Vainsencher's first child,
            <cite>Mom</cite> shows the many roles she takes on as a daughter turned mother to a daughter. As though
            pulled
            in many directions, the clay surface bears the touch of a million clamoring fingerprints. The deeply
            textured
            surfaces recall the busy hands manipulating clay objects in <cite>Negative Capability</cite>. In
            <cite>Mom</cite>, hands are also constantly doing things, now cooking, shampooing, and carrying. In
            <cite>Inheritance</cite>, the textures of <cite>Mom</cite> mimic the enframing form of the
            <cite>Gamra</cite>
            page, also becoming a frame for the video works Vainsencher created as her mother's daughter.
          </p>
          <p class="text">Many of the works in the exhibition take the visual shape of a frame: from the hollow ceramic
            cylinders and circles in <cite>Negative Capability</cite>, to the panning semi-circle arcs gestured in
            <cite>Duet</cite>, to the bracketing device of entrances and exits that motivate <cite>Leslie Across the
              Floor</cite>, to the anticipation that holds attention in <cite>Here It Comes</cite>, to the curatorial
            decision to use the textures of <cite>Mom</cite> as a border around video works. These enframing forms make
            reference to the Talmud which inspires the design of the <cite>Inheritance</cite> exhibition. They also
            function much like a family does—they encircle, enshrine, and protect something precious at the center.
          </p>
          <p class="text">Vainsencher is also inspired by the Jewish practice of learning together,
            <cite>Be'Tzavta</cite>, which she loosely translates as “as a team; together.” <cite>Be'Tzavta</cite>
            involves
            reading as a group and discussing a text while seated together in a circle, a practiced she was introduced
            to
            by the artist Ofri Cnaani's feminist reading group at AIR gallery. Once again, “there is a center but the
            center is empty.” Vainsencher consciously connects <cite>Be'Tzavta</cite> to the anti-hierarchical feminist
            approaches she applies throughout her work. At Baruch, she will present a special participatory performance
            of
            <cite>Here It Comes</cite> that literally embodies <cite>Be'Tzavta</cite> circular communal form.
            Additionally, at the New Media Artspace in-person exhibition, she shares several of the artifacts and
            process
            pieces that contribute to her work, inviting viewers into her process by creating an intimate learning
            community in the Newman Library. Mirroring the <cite>Gamra</cite> page and the <cite>Be'Tzavta</cite>
            practices, encircling text and (re)interpretive commentary underpin Vainsencher's process at every level. In
            <cite>Inheritance</cite>, these are continually come around, revolving and enframing through the artist's
            reinventions, reincarnations, and inheritances.

            Gabriela Vainsencher speaks with Silvia Ruzanka</h2>
          <p class="text"><span class="italic">This year the New Media Artspace presents two solo exhibitions by
              Gabriela Vainsencher and Silvia Ruzanka. Each addresses <em>process</em> from an expanded perspective,
              extending from artistic and psychoanalytical processes to botanical and computational processes. In
              conjunction with Vainsencher's exhibition, Ruzanka interviews Vainsencher as the first part of a two-way
              dialogue between the artists on their works in relation to these and more ideas.</span></p><br>
          <p class="text">
            <span class="bolder">Silvia Ruzanka:</span> Watching <cite>Negative Capability</cite> and thinking of what
            question to begin with, that archetypal psychoanalysis question almost seems appropriate: <em>tell me about
              your mother.</em> You talk about connections between her work as a psychoanalyst and your work as an
            artist. Was that something you discovered in the process of making that piece?
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <span class="bolder">Gabriela Vainsencher:</span> I was always fascinated with my mother's work and the way
            it informed how she sees the world. Growing up, psychoanalytical theory was not a remote academic subject.
            It was sayings peppered into everyday conversations, the lens through which people and situations were
            discussed. It was only when I started being exposed to Freud as an undergraduate that I realized there was
            an external source for these models: they were not all my mom's ideas! I then started asking her more about
            her work and she told me about people like Melanie Klein, Wilfred Bion, and Donald Winnicott.
            <br>
            When I started working on the recordings that would become <cite>Negative Capability</cite>, the first thing
            I asked her was to explain to me what an interpretation was. To me, this is the most mysterious part of the
            psychoanalytic process, and the one closest to artistic inspiration. It is the moment in which the analyst
            creates something with and for the patient. It's something that was not there before, and yet it is
            connected to everything that was said (and not said) previous to its creation. It parallels in this way the
            creative process, in which there is a sequence, a progression of ideas and methods, but the real magical
            moments in art are the ones in which this progression suddenly births something completely new—an image, an
            idea, a way of seeing the world that both is connected to the artist's practice, but also is new and
            unexpected by the artist.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <span class="bolder">SR:</span> One of the threads I see in your work is the cyclical nature of things:
            beginnings and ends, undulations, repetition that returns but always with variation. (I have a fascination
            with the Möebius strip, a shape that's cyclic but turns in on itself.) I'm interested in how you think about
            these cyclical patterns, the motions of the body, motions of the waves, cycles of everyday activities?
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <span class="bolder">GV:</span> My interest in cycles is connected to feminism and the postmodern rejection
            of art history as a linear progression. And personally, I don't believe in progression of any sort in a
            straight line. My growth as a person and as an artist has always been in loops—I end up back where I was,
            but this time I am myself a little bit changed, and so I find myself in a different position.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <span class="bolder">SR:</span> With ceramics there's often an association with a finished product and with
            a kind of permanence. In your work there's an emphasis on process, on open-ended, unfinished states. How do
            you think about ceramics in these pieces? Do they create a kind of tension? Or do you see ceramics
            differently?
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <span class="bolder">GV:</span> What I love most about clay is how it starts its life as the most malleable,
            most changeable material, and ends up one of the most permanent ones. When I work with clay I try to stay
            very connected to its potential for change, for capturing fleeting moments like a finger's impression, a
            drawn line pressed into it, a wrinkle. All the while, I know that once it goes in the kiln, it is likely to
            outlive anything else I produce by thousands of years. I also enjoy how cheap clay is. I have a hard time
            working with expensive materials. They feel finished somehow, before I've touched them. Clay is dirt, it
            means nothing and costs very little, and gives me the freedom to waste it, which for me is very necessary
            for my creative process.

          <p class="text">
            <span class="bolder">SR:</span> <cite>Mom</cite> resonates with me in a number of ways, in the imagery and
            in some of my own experience. I'm interested in your thoughts and experience of motherhood, across different
            cultures and particularly through the lens of the pandemic.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            <span class="bolder">GV:</span> When I became a mother, I experienced a profound shift in identity from one
            that was centered around being someone's daughter to being someone's mother. This shifted the way I
            perceived myself in time—suddenly I was no longer an endpoint, but a passageway into the future. This is a
            very common thing to realize; it happens to anyone that creates another generation. But it's nonetheless a
            powerful force, which affected not only how I planned my life (meaning, I started planning my life rather
            than just living it), but also profoundly changed my work.
            <br>
            I made <cite>Mom</cite> when my daughter was two years old, about a year into the pandemic. It is a
            self-portrait as a mother, depicted while doing a lot of tasks that have nothing to do with being an artist.
            But of course, as I was making it I was in the studio, finally, after having been forced into being a stay
            at home mom and not having a studio for over a year. It was the largest sculpture I had ever made. It took
            many months and meticulous planning and patience—skills motherhood had taught me. The pandemic was a
            difficult time to be a mother, but being a mother also saved my sanity during it. It forced me to laugh
            every day, to have hope. I am writing this text in the first week of the war in Israel—where I grew up and
            where my parents and many friends are. Again, I have a young child—I gave birth to our son almost three
            months ago. Caring for him and for our daughter is what keeps me hopeful, what forces me to look away from
            the harrowing news and into the sunshine, to go to the studio and make art and hope for a better future for
            my kids.
